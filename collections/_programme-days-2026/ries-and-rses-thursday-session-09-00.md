description: "Discover how Research Infrastructure Engineers (RIEs) and Research Software Engineers (RSEs) can work together to boost HPC user confidence and improve cluster efficiency.
We’ll be sharing results from the first ACIT hub hackathon, showcasing approaches for improving user efficiency on accelerated compute clusters, along with dashboards for system administrators and users that can help highlight issues at a glance.
Take part in facilitated discussions to shape future hackathons, get under the hood of the cluster and into the minds of users, explore real pain points at the software–hardware boundary, and help define where intervention could have the biggest impact."
