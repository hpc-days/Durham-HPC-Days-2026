description: "Our community broadly agrees on the importance of improving equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI). We also often know what we should be doing, or how to get help, due to the wealth of guidance and expertise that has already been developed and curated. Yet, progress is slow. Why isn’t this happening? How do we take our ambitions and drive real, impactful change?

This session aims to address the “implementation gap”: the disconnect between knowing what needs to be done to improve EDI and successfully putting those actions into practice. The focus is on moving beyond awareness-raising towards practical, actionable change.

The session will begin with short presentations introducing different contexts where EDI challenges have been identified, alongside the efforts made to address them. These will include gender imbalance in EuroHPC applications, experiences of forming diverse panels within UKRI and challenges faced by the CAKE-CoSeC EDI working group when implementing existing EDI advice.

Participants will take part in interactive breakout discussions to identify and propose solutions at different levels of influence: individual actions (“what can I do?”), leadership responsibilities (“what can my boss do?”), and changes required at the structural, policy and decision-makers level. These discussions will focus on developing strategies that can be taken forward to EuroHPC, UKRI, CAKE and CoSeC, to directly contribute to closing the gap between intent and impact."
