description: "Modern astronomy operates at petascale; from sky surveys generating millions of images per night to large-scale cosmological simulations. This session examines how AI and HPC intersect in astronomy, highlighting real computational challenges and lessons that generalise to other disciplines. We explore how AI models are trained, deployed, and validated on HPC infrastructure, and what this teaches us about scaling AI beyond the cloud."
