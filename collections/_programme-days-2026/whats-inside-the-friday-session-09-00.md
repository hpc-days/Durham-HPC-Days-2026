description: "What’s inside the black box? Compiler developments for HPC brings together compiler developers, standards contributors, and HPC practitioners to discuss how recent advancements in compilation techniques impact the performance, portability, and correctness of scientific codes on today’s increasingly heterogeneous systems. Speakers from academia and industry will highlight emerging compiler infrastructures, advances in optimisation, directive-based programming, data layout, accelerator support, tools for understanding and guiding optimisation decisions, and domain-specific approaches that raise productivity while preserving trust, reproducibility, and predictable behaviour in high-performance computing workflows for real-world scientific applications."
