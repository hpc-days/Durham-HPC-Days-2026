description: "Meet our first cohort of DRI knowledge exchange (KE) fellows! In this session, our KE fellows will present their work on championing and facilitating knowledge exchange in their subcommunities, reflect on the challenges they encountered during their first months, and talk about future plans.

We will also discuss general hurdles and tools for knowledge exchange and sharing, and what each of us can do to make sure we stay connected and informed, and create synergy in our field."
