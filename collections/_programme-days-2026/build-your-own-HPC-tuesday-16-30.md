description: "Nothing beats hands-on experience. But very few people will ever get to work with real HPC hardware. Most of us have probably never seen the HPCs we are working on.
An easy way to get hands on experience with real and relatively affordable hardware is to use Raspberry Pi single board computers.
In this session we will have attendees work in pairs. Each pair will receive a pair of Raspberry Pis and a 5 port switch. We will then work through configuring one of the Pis as a login node and the other as a compute node. We will install and configure slurm, nfs, munge, lmod, EESSI and cvfms. At this point attendees should be able to to srun the Amdahl script from the Carpentries' Intro to HPC lesson.
If time allows we can also look at putting all the RPis together to create one large HPC. Large being a relative concept of course.
We currently have 10 RPis and five switches available which means we can accommodate at least ten people. If people can bring their own hardware we could accommodate more. Or, if we can manage to get sponsorship for more hardware we will also be happy to accommodate more people."
