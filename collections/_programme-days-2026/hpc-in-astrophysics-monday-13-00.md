description: "HPC is an indispensable discipline in astrophysics and cosmology with many users running simulations, solving intricate networks of nonlinear equations, post-processing and analysing data, and synthesising images, spectra, and mock observations on a daily basis. Despite its crucial importance to the field, the presentation and discussion of our HPC work often falls short during astronomy and astrophysics conferences, which tend to focus on physics outputs and outcomes.

This session serves as a platform to exchange and highlight all the underlying HPC work, both current an in progress, as well as challenges in the astrophysics and astronomy communities."
