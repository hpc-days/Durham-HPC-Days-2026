description: "The Fortran community has historically been somewhat fragmented, but recent years have seen a surge in community activity and engagement. Keeping up momentum from Back to the Fortran Future meetups at RSECon and the SSI Collaborations Workshop, this session will bring together Fortran programmers to share best practices and discuss recent developments in the community. It will consist of a series of short talks followed by a breakout discussion session to identify the challenges facing the community and prioritise future work. Possible topics could include tooling, testing, and community engagement."
