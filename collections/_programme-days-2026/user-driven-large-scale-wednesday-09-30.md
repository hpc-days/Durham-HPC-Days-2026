description: "Large-scale data transfer between HPC facilities ought to be a solved problem. However, from a user perspective, it is often unnecessarily complex. This session will explore use cases and successes in large scale transfer, and report on outcomes from several
NFCS+ projects based around large scale data transfer. Steps taken towards this in areas such as cosmology, nuclear fusion and astronomy will be presented, including facilities with large data sets such as the Vera Rubin telescope. "
